HAAR.js Feature Detection Library for javascript and HTML5 canvas

based on Viola-Jones Feature Detection Algorithm using Haar Cascades

This is a port of OpenCV C++ Haar Detection (actually a port of JViolaJones which is a port of OpenCV for Java)
to javascript and HTML5 canvas.

You can use the openCV cascades to build your detectors.

To do this just transform the opencv xml file to javascript
using the haartojs tool (in cascades folder)

example:
( to use opencv's haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml  run following command)
haartojs haarcascades_frontalface_alt 

this creates a javascript file:
haarcascades_frontalface_alt.js which you can include in your html file

the variable to use in javascript
is similarly
haarcascades_frontalface_alt

The Code works in the browser and inside nodejs

Runing inside the brower
 Loading wth script tags
 Loading with RequireJS 

Running inside node
 For running, the package have a dependency on canvas
 You can find an example inside examples/nodes.js

Valide Output
node examples/node.js

[{"x":102.5,"y":105.5,"width":160.66666666666666,"height":160.66666666666666}]

To work properly canvas need some system depencency
You can find instruction on https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki
For example for Ubuntu : 
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev
