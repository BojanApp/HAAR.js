HAAR.js Feature Detection Library for javascript and HTML5 canvas

based on Viola-Jones Feature Detection Algorithm using Haar Cascades

This is a port of OpenCV C++ Haar Detection (actually a port of JViolaJones which is a port of OpenCV for Java)
to javascript and HTML5 canvas.

You can use the openCV cascades to build your detectors.

To do this just transform tyhe opencv xml file to javascript
using the haartojs tool (in cascades folder)

example:
( to use opencv's haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml  run following command)
haartojs haarcascades_frontalface_alt 

this creates a javascript file:
haarcascades_frontalface_alt.js which you can include in your html file

the variable to use in javascript
is similarly
haarcascades_frontalface_alt

Examples  included with face and mouth detction
